# A Functionalized Sensor for Museum Monitoring 
###### Qian WANG, Emmanuel, qw251

## Project summary
The project aims to develop a hardware system for museum environmental monitoring based on integrated warp platform. It provides an entry-level prototype for highly integrated low-cost monitoring system suitable for large-scale deployment. 

Three main contributions, both research and commericalization are listed as follows; (a) Acquire data and knowledge for museum environmental factors; (b) Based on the abundant data collected, enable the potential for better museum structural design and improve the daily relic preservation strategies; (c) Lower system cost can potentially lead to higher deployment rates for not only research but also commercial use. 

This project would eventually beneÔ¨Åt those who are working for preservation in the areas like museums. It can also provide a low-cost monitoring system solution for researchers focusing on real-time environmental performance analyses.

## Repository layout
The system firmware is built based upon Warp-firmware, made available to public by Physical Computation Laboratory, Cambridge.

In order for the project to work, it is essential to do the following.

    cd ./Warp-firmware/build/ksdk1.1.0
and then type in

    ./build.sh
to build the project.

To run the system, use the following commands

    /Applications/SEGGER/JLink/JLinkExe -device MKL03Z32XXX4 -if SWD -speed 4000 -CommanderScript ../../tools/scripts/jlink.commands
In the other shell window, launch the JLink RTT client to interact with the Warp platform and obtain the raw data.

Full information on how to configure Warp-firmware is shown in https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-firmware

Except for the repositories present in the link above. There are three repositories. The raw data for measurements are stored in the /Data folder. The /Reference folder contains datasheets as well as references. The /BME680 Driver folder in warp-firmware/src/boot contains the referenced Bosch code for data calibration and ADC value convertion.
